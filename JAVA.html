  <h2>JAVA이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  Formed mostly as the result of volcanic eruptions from geologic subduction between Sunda Plate and Australian Plate, Java is the 13th largest island in the world and the fifth largest in Indonesia by landmass at about 138,800 square kilometres (53,600 sq mi). A chain of volcanic mountains forms an east–west spine along the island. Three main languages are spoken on the island: Javanese, Sundanese, and Madurese, where Javanese is the most spoken; it is the native language of about 60 millioJavanese people in Indonesia, most of whom live on Java. Furthermore, most residents are bilingual,<br>
  speaking Indonesian (the official language of Indonesia) as their first or second language.<br>
While the majority of the people of Java are Muslim, Java's population comprises people of diverse religious beliefs, ethnicities, and cultures.<br>
Java is divided into four administrative provinces, West Java, Central Java, East Java, and Banten, <br>
and two special regions, Jakarta and Yogyakarta.<br>
